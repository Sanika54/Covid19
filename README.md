PROJECT NAME: COVID-19 Data Analysis
Overview
This project analyze COVID-19 data to understand trends and impacts, using data science techniques
outlined in a Udemy course. It follows the CRISP-DM methodology, providing a hands-on approach to
data analysis.
Objectives
1. Gather and clean COVID-19 data.
2. Analyze trends and insights.
3. Create visualizations.
4. Apply machine learning for predictions.
5. Build dynamic dashboards.
Methodology
1. Business Understanding
Analyze COVID-19 data to guide public health decisions.
2. Data Gathering
Data was collected via REST services and APIs, including daily cases, vaccination rates, and
demographics.
3. Data Preparation
Data was cleaned using Python’s Pandas:
• Handled missing values.
• Normalized data for comparisons.
• Parsed date columns for time series analysis.
4. Data Analysis and Visualization
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics and visualizations to identify trends.
• Dynamic Dashboards: Created with Plotly and Dash to visualize daily cases, cumulative
totals, and vaccination progress.
5. Machine Learning Techniques
• Linear Regression: Model relationships between variables.
• Exponential Modeling: Forecasted future cases.
• Time Series Forecasting: Used Facebook Prophet for predictions.
Conclusion
• The project effectively applied data science practices to COVID-19 analysis, providing
valuable insights and an interactive dashboard for monitoring.
